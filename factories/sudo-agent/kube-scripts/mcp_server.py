"""Per-pod MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for sudo-agent.

A thin wrapper over the ``hermes-p.py`` prompt surface: it exposes the
``hermes_prompt`` tool that runs ``hermes -z PROMPT`` against THIS pod's own
agent — no kubectl, no kubeconfig, no cross-agent routing.

It runs INSIDE a sudo-agent pod and serves streamable HTTP (the modern
MCP-over-HTTP transport) on ``MCP_PORT`` (default 8000). The endpoint path is
``/mcp``.

PROMPT DISTRIBUTOR (queue) LAYER
--------------------------------
Between the agent's MCP door and the agent's brain sits a Redis-backed queue.
The ``hermes_prompt`` tool NO LONGER spawns ``hermes -z`` immediately; it
ENQUEUES the prompt and a single in-pod drain worker feeds the agent ONE
prompt at a time. N rapid prompts = N queued runs, never N parallel runs
racing the same agent state.

Tool surface:
    hermes_prompt(prompt, json=False, mode="inbox", source="")
        mode "inbox" (default): enqueue and return a message id immediately.
                       The id is stable and referenceable, so a check(message_id)
                       tool can be added later without breaking changes.
        mode "direct": enqueue and WAIT for the reply (synchronous, no
                       timeout — long jobs are fine; explicit opt-in).
        source:       id of the MCP client/session that enqueued (used for
                       the group-by-source ordering rule; defaults to the
                       FastMCP session id, or "default").

    hermes_queue_status()
        In-flight + pending queue + recent processed results (ids, sources,
        timestamps) — the operator's observability window into the distributor.

ORDERING RULES (implemented verbatim, see DESIGN.md / OBSERVABILITY.md):
    a. first message in = processed first
    b. then drain ALL remaining messages from that same source before anyone
       else
    c. when empty, move to the NEXT MOST RECENT source and drain it fully
    d. FIFO within a source

BACKING STORE — the SHARED sudo-agent-redis (deployed by kube-scripts/redis-up.sh)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
up.sh injects ``REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:<port>/0`` into every agent pod, so
the fleet-wide SHARED Redis is what a deployed agent actually uses. That Redis
runs ``hostNetwork: true`` and binds the NODE's loopback because every agent pod
is ``hostNetwork: true`` too and therefore shares the node's network namespace:
``127.0.0.1`` inside any agent pod IS the node's loopback. This is deliberate —
it needs no DNS and no Service. A hostNetwork pod with the default dnsPolicy
gets the NODE resolver, not cluster DNS, so the ClusterIP Service name is NOT
resolvable from an agent pod; do not point REDIS_URL at a Service name.

Queue namespacing (why two agents cannot steal each other's prompts):
    One Redis serves the whole fleet, so the key prefix must be unique per
    agent: ``QUEUE_BASE = sudo-agent:q:<unique-per-agent>``, giving keys like
    ``sudo-agent:q:<name>:items`` / ``:inflight`` / ``:res:<msg-id>``.
    The suffix is QUEUE_NAME if set, else AGENT_NAME (injected by up.sh from the
    agent name, which is unique per deployment because the deployment is
    ``sudo-<agent>``), else POD_NAME (unique by definition), else MCP_PORT
    (derived by up.sh from the agent name via cksum, so unique modulo a
    1-in-24768 hash collision). AGENT_NAME is preferred because it is both
    readable in redis-cli and collision-proof.

OFFLINE FALLBACK: when REDIS_URL is UNSET, mcp_entrypoint.sh starts a per-pod
``redis-server`` on ``REDIS_PORT`` — and that port is derived per agent there
(never 6379/6380), because with hostNetwork even "localhost" ports are
node-global. The fallback is for offline/degraded operation only; the PVC it
writes to is ``/opt/data/redis``, so it survives container restarts and pod
recreation for as long as the PVC exists. Results carry a 7-day TTL.

Flag mapping (== hermes-p.py's functional surface, nothing more, nothing less):
    prompt -> hermes-p.py positional prompt
    json   -> hermes-p.py --json (pretty-print iff stdout is valid JSON, else
              pass the raw text through unchanged)

NOT exposed here (host-side only — needs kubectl/kubeconfig):
    --list / cross-agent name resolution. Inside a pod there is no apiserver
    access; this pod IS the agent. See DESIGN.md and hermes_prompt.py.

Note on --stream / --new-chat: ``hermes -z`` has no stream-json delta mode and
is stateless per invocation, so those CLI flags are no-ops kept only for CLI
parity in hermes-p.py. They are not exposed as tool params here — there is
nothing for them to do.
