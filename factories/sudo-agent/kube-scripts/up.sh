# The manifest below is an UNQUOTED heredoc, so bash performs command
# substitution over its ENTIRE body — including the YAML comments. It is thus
# possible, and it has happened, to write a comment that the shell silently
# EXECUTES: the annotation comment here previously contained an unescaped
# backtick-quoted kubectl invocation, so every single deploy ran kubectl,
# failed, and substituted the empty result into the manifest while printing
# the useless "must specify one of -f and -k" line. The manifest still
# parsed, so nothing ever failed — a real apply error would have been lost in
# a line operators had been trained to ignore.
#
# So the body is scanned before it is used. Exactly two things may appear:
#   * the THREE $(sed 's/^/    /' ...) indent helpers that embed the ConfigMap
#     payloads (no more, no fewer — a new one is either a mistake or needs a
#     deliberate update here);
#   * plain $VAR references (DEPLOY, NAME, ports, digest, ...).
# Any backtick that is not backslash-escaped, or any extra command
# substitution, aborts before anything is written. No silent fallback: if the
# boundaries cannot be found, we refuse to deploy.

# apply error would have been buried in a line operators had learned to ignore.
# Escaping is the fix; this check is the backstop. It refuses to hand a
