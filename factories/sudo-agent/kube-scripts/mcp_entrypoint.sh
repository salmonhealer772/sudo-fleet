# Per-pod MCP supervisor for sudo-agent.
#
# The sudo-agent image has NO own CMD/entrypoint: up.sh runs the BASE image's
# entrypoint with `args: ["gateway", "run"]`, and `gateway run` (a long-running
# Hermes gateway) IS the pod's main process. So, unlike sudo-letta, there is no
# `tail -f /dev/null` to swap in — we must ADD the MCP server alongside the
# gateway WITHOUT replacing it.
#
# This script is the image ENTRYPOINT. It:
#   1. NO-OP when REDIS_URL (shared sudo-agent-redis, injected by up.sh) is set —
#      the distributor then uses the SHARED fleet Redis. Only when REDIS_URL is
#      UNSET does it start a per-pod localhost Redis (offline fallback, AOF on)
#      here;
#   2. starts the MCP server (the FastMCP streamable-HTTP wrapper over
#      hermes-p) in the background, in a restart loop so a crash doesn't take
#      the endpoint down permanently;
#   3. execs the base image's entrypoint dispatcher with the original args
#      (`gateway run`), so the gateway starts EXACTLY as before under the
#      s6-overlay supervision tree.
#
# The MCP server (and its drain worker) runs as the hermes user (uid 10000,
# HOME=/opt/data) so its `hermes -z` subprocesses and any files it writes are
# uid-aligned with the supervised gateway — the same ownership the existing
# `kubectl exec ... hermes -z` flow relies on. MCP_PORT is the per-agent port
# (unique because every sudo-agent pod runs hostNetwork:true and would
# otherwise collide); it defaults to 8000 and is normally injected by up.sh.
#
# PORTS IN THIS POD ARE NODE-GLOBAL. With hostNetwork:true the pod shares the
# node's network namespace, so "localhost" is the NODE's loopback and every
# listener is visible to every other hostNetwork pod on the node. That is why
# every port here is per-agent-unique: MCP_PORT (cksum of the agent name),
# WATCH_PORT (cksum of "<name>-watch"), and the fallback Redis port below —
# which must never be 6379 (owned by the sudo-letta fleet's Redis) or 6380
# (owned by our shared sudo-agent-redis).
#
# Redis data dir: /opt/data/redis/ (the agent PVC) — the fallback queue then
# survives container restarts and pod recreation as long as the PVC persists;
# only losing the PVC loses it.

set -u

# Comm layer: seed the fleet comm skills + persona snippet on FIRST boot
# only. The tools are baked into the image (Dockerfile COPY ->
# /opt/comm-tools/), but Hermes reads skills from $HERMES_HOME/skills (=
# /opt/data/skills, the PVC) and its identity from SOUL.md (also the PVC),
# which start empty on a fresh engineer. A .comm-seeded marker makes this
# idempotent: restarts skip it, and the agent's later edits to skills/ or
# SOUL.md are preserved. Safe no-ops when a dir/file is absent: every seeding
# step is `|| true`, so a missing source or an unwritable PVC can never block
# first boot — worst case the agent starts unseeded, still runs.
