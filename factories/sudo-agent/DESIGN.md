# Design — sudo-agent

## What It Is

One command. Hermes Agent on DeepSeek — contained in Docker. Multiple agents by name, each isolated in its own container with full privileged root access and zero host escape.

## Deploy path — use `bin/`

| Path | Status | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| `bin/` | **The real path** (k3s) | Per-agent MCP service, prompt-distributor queue on a shared Redis, observer (watch) sidecar, `stream.sh`, `hermes-p.py` |

`setup.sh` builds the image. Everything else you want lives in `bin/`.

## Scripts (`bin/`)

| Script | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `up.sh --name` | Create or restart `sudo-{name}` (privileged) | Generates sudo password on first run; provisions the shared queue Redis; injects `REDIS_URL` |
| `down.sh --name` | Stop `sudo-{name}`, PVC persists | Memory survives |
| `talk.sh --name` | `kubectl exec -it deploy/sudo-{name} -- hermes` | Talks to the agent |
| `ssh.sh --name` | `kubectl exec -it deploy/sudo-{name} -- bash` | Root shell |
| `redis-up.sh` | Deploy/refresh the shared queue Redis (`sudo-agent-redis`) | Idempotent, loud on failure, run by `up.sh` and `setup.sh` |
| `rm-containers.sh --name` | Force-remove one deployment | — |
| `rm-containers.sh --ALL` | Force-remove **all** `sudo-*` deployments | Nuke button |
| `stream.sh --name [-t]` | Live TOKEN stream (default), or the distilled transcript | `--thinking` / `--answer` / `--context` filters, `--events` for the old tape |
| `watch_plugin/` | Hermes plugin: token-level stream tap | stdlib only; shipped via `sudo-<name>-watch-plugin` ConfigMap |
| `watch_plugin_enable.py` | Enables the plugin in a per-agent config | Surgical text edit + re-parse; called by `up.sh` |
| `hermes-p.py` | Host-side one-shot prompt CLI | `--list`, name resolution, `--json` |
| `mcp_server.py` / `mcp_entrypoint.sh` | Per-pod MCP server + supervisor | Baked into the image |
| `watch_sidecar.py` | Observer daemon (events/transcript/HTTP tap) | Ships via ConfigMap |

## Naming

- Deployment: `sudo-{name}` (bare name = agent name; some bare names legitimately start with `sudo-`, e.g. `sudo-agent-maintainer-h` → `sudo-sudo-agent-maintainer-h`)
- PVC: `sudo-{name}-data`
- PVC (queue): `sudo-agent-redis-data`
- `--ALL` is reserved. Every script rejects `--all` as an agent name.

## Config

- Hub `.env` — API keys, sudo password (git-ignored)
- `config.yaml` — Hermes config **template**
- `config/<name>.yaml` — the **per-agent** config actually mounted into `sudo-{name}` (generated on first deploy, then left alone so agents can diverge)

## Inside Each Container

- **Privileged mode** — all capabilities, all devices, seccomp+apparmor disabled
- Docker socket mounted at `/var/run/docker.sock` — can run Docker commands
- Hermes Agent gateway running (background)
- DeepSeek via custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`api.deepseek.com/v1`)
- Auto memory (MEMORY.md 100k chars + USER.md 50k chars injected at session start)
  - nudge_interval: 1 (reviews memory every turn)
- Session search (FTS5) for older conversations
- `SUDO_PASSWORD` env var set — agent can `sudo` anything
- `REDIS_URL` env var set — points the prompt distributor at the shared fleet Redis
- **Cannot reach the host** — Docker security boundary

## Design rules: hostNetwork (read before touching ports or DNS)

Every sudo-agent pod runs `hostNetwork: true`, so it shares the NODE's network
namespace. Three consequences are load-bearing:

1. **There is no cluster DNS in an agent pod.** With the default dnsPolicy
   (`ClusterFirst`), Kubernetes falls back to the NODE's resolver for a
   hostNetwork pod, so a ClusterIP Service name (`sudo-agent-redis`,
   `kubernetes.default`, `sudo-<name>-mcp`) does **not** resolve inside an agent
   pod. Only a pod that explicitly sets `dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet`
   gets cluster DNS. **This is why the naive "point REDIS_URL at the Service"
   design silently failed**: the URL never resolved, the MCP server's queue
   fell through to a local fallback, and nothing said so. Services remain
   usable *by ClusterIP*, never *by name*.
2. **Every port a pod binds is a NODE-GLOBAL port.** `127.0.0.1` inside an
   agent pod **is** the node's loopback. So:
   - `MCP_PORT` and `WATCH_PORT` are unique per agent (cksum-derived from the
     agent name) — a fixed port would collide between agents.
   - The shared Redis binds `127.0.0.1` on purpose (that is the reachable path
     from every agent pod without DNS), which makes its port a node-global
     resource too, so exactly one Redis process per port per node.
   - Binding `0.0.0.0` anywhere here would expose an unauthenticated queue to
     the LAN.
3. **Therefore the shared queue Redis runs `hostNetwork: true` bound to
   `127.0.0.1`**, and agent pods reach it as
   `redis://127.0.0.1:<SUDO_AGENT_REDIS_PORT>/0` (default **6380**).
   Node port **6379 is owned by `sudo-letta-redis`** (the companion fleet); the
   Hermes fleet owns **6380**. `redis-up.sh` preflights the port and aborts
   loudly if anything other than this deployment's own Redis holds it, rather
   than crashlooping. If the two fleets are ever to share one port, the Letta
   fleet is the one that must move — see the header of `bin/redis-up.sh`.

## Design rule: whole-runtime observability (read before touching the watch surface)

The observer sidecar can only report what the agent has **finished**: it polls
`/opt/data/state.db`, and Hermes writes a `messages` row only when a message is
COMPLETE. No partial row exists while the model streams, so "every word the
agent thinks, in real time" is impossible from the DB by construction — not a
matter of polling faster.

1. **The tap is a Hermes plugin, not a poller.** `bin/watch_plugin/`
   registers callbacks on Hermes' native hooks
   (`on_stream_start` / `on_stream_delta` / `on_stream_end` /
   `pre_api_request` / `post_api_request` / `pre_tool_call` /
   `post_tool_call`) and appends to `<HERMES_HOME>/watch/stream.jsonl`.
   Deltas are true per-token chunks (`kind: text|reasoning`), `pre_api_request`
   hands over the full sanitised request body — the exact context the model is
   about to think against — on every API call, and the tool hooks carry the
   **FULL** arguments and **FULL** result body of every tool call. The tap is
   deliberately the whole runtime, not a token lane.
2. **Discovery and enablement are pinned.** A `standalone` plugin loads only
   when its key is in `plugins.enabled`; reasoning deltas only flow with
   `plugins.stream_reasoning_deltas: true`. `up.sh` therefore (a) ships the
   plugin as `sudo-<name>-watch-plugin` mounted read-only at
   `/opt/data/plugins/sudo-watch-stream/` — the user-plugin dir for
   `HERMES_HOME=/opt/data` — in BOTH containers, and (b) edits
   `config/<name>.yaml` with `watch_plugin_enable.py`. That helper is a
   surgical TEXT edit (operator comments and unrelated settings survive) whose
   result is re-parsed with a real YAML parser before it replaces the file;
   it refuses to touch a config that does not parse.
3. **In-band callbacks must never hurt the agent.**
   `pre_api_request` fires inline on the request path, so its callback only
   builds a small dict of references and queue-puts it: truncation, JSON
   encoding and file I/O all happen on a daemon writer thread. The queue is
   bounded (20000) and **drops the oldest** rather than blocking, and every
   callback is wrapped in try/except. Hermes itself dispatches
   `on_stream_delta` on a per-consumer thread with a 1024-deep queue, so a
   slow sink throttles the hook — which is exactly why the writer must be
   fast and must never raise.
4. **The deploy proves itself or fails.** After `kubectl apply`, `up.sh` waits
   for the rollout and then, inside the pod, asks Hermes' own plugin manager
   how many callbacks are registered for **all seven** hooks. Any hook
   reporting zero aborts the deploy loudly and names it. A pod that silently
   ships no stream — or worse, streams tokens while quietly dropping every
   tool call — is the failure mode this rule exists to prevent.
   (`SUDO_AGENT_SKIP_STREAM_PROBE=1` is the documented, discouraged escape
   hatch.)
5. **Rejected alternative: an on-wire SSE tap.** Tracing the provider
   connection would also give true token rate, but the watch container has NO
   effective capabilities (`CapEff: 0000000000000000`) so it cannot ptrace at
   all, and a tracer inside the agent container would couple the observer to
   the runtime. The plugin keeps the observer's core property — it only reads
   the agent, never changes it.
6. **Non-streaming paths are covered, not ignored.** A turn that never streams
   is a measured reality on this fleet for cron and delegated/subagent
   contexts (cli/gateway turns do stream). Those calls still emit
   `input_context`, a `stream_end` marked `synthesized: true` (`delta_count:
   0`) and a `completion` carrying the finished text with `streamed: false`.
   Nothing is silently absent, and the gap is labelled rather than papered
   over.
7. **Additive by construction.** `stream.jsonl` / `plugin.json` and the new
   `/stream` behaviour sit beside `events.jsonl`, `transcript.txt`, state.db
   capture, the MCP prompt surface and the Redis queue; the previous events
   tail is preserved verbatim at `/events-stream`. Agents pick it up on their
   next `up.sh` roll — the surface is per-agent, so no fleet-wide cutover is
   needed (and none should be done without operator sign-off).
8. **The log and the console are the SAME level of detail.** This is an
   explicit, deliberate reversal of ordinary CLI taste, mandated by the
   operator: *"THE ENTIRE AGENT RUNTIME FULLY STREAMED AND I WANT THE LOGGING
   TO BE THE SAME LEVEL"* and *"i want the default view for stream.sh TO SHOW
   LIVE AS MUCH DETAIL OF AGENT ACTIVITY AS CAN BE MONITORED … THE ENTIRE
   AGENT."* Trimming is OPT-IN (`--no-logs`, `--no-activity`,
   `?kinds=` on `/stream`); the default everywhere is everything. Do not
   "tidy up" the default view — that is the product.
9. **The screen is never silently frozen.** Hermes emits nothing while the
   model generates tool-call arguments, while a tool runs, and while the
   provider is thinking. A phase machine plus a watchdog in the plugin emit
   `activity` beats on a bounded cadence (default 2 s) for the whole duration
   of a turn, so the operator is never left staring at a screen wondering
   whether the agent died. The measurable form of the rule lives in
   `/status` → `stream.silent_for_s`.
10. **Housekeeping is shown, not hidden.** cron / subagent / curator turns are
    tagged `housekeeping: true` (filterable) but recorded AND rendered, unlike
    `transcript.txt`, which suppresses them. The distinction is a
    surface/platform heuristic — the raw `surface` rides on every event so a
    consumer can re-classify — and that limitation is stated rather than
    papered over.
11. **The agent's own log lines are part of the feed.** `agent.log` and
    `gateway.log` are mirrored into the tape from EOF, so errors, warnings and
    retries appear next to the tokens that caused them instead of in a file
    nobody is tailing.

## MCP Service

Each `sudo-{name}` pod runs an MCP server (streamable HTTP) that wraps the
`hermes-p` prompt surface. It is deployed by `up.sh` as part of the same
generated YAML, and runs inside the pod (as the `hermes` user, `HOME=/opt/data`),
so it prompts that pod's own agent directly — no kubectl, no kubeconfig, no
cross-agent routing.

- **Service**: `sudo-{name}-mcp` (ClusterIP). Stable client-facing port `8000`,
  targetPort a unique per-agent port (derived from the agent name) because every
  sudo-agent pod runs `hostNetwork: true` and a fixed port would collide.
- **URL**: `http://sudo-{name}-mcp:8000/mcp` (reachable by ClusterIP/DNS from
  *non*-hostNetwork clients; agent pods must use the targetPort on the node).
- **Tools**: `hermes_prompt(prompt, json, mode, source)` — `direct` (enqueue and
  wait, no timeout) or `inbox` (enqueue and return a stable `msg-<12hex>` id);
  `hermes_queue_status()` — in-flight + pending queue + recent results.
  `hermes -z` is stateless per invocation, so there is no conversation resume.
  `--stream` / `--new-chat` are CLI-parity no-ops and are not tool params.
- **Single source of truth**: `bin/hermes_prompt.py` holds the hermes
  `-z` command construction, the JSON pass-through formatting, and the host-side
  agent listing / name resolution. Both `hermes-p.py` (host CLI) and
  `mcp_server.py` (in-pod MCP) import it.
- **Process model** (differs from sudo-letta): the sudo-agent image has no own
  CMD/entrypoint — `up.sh` runs the base image's `gateway run` via `args`, and
  that long-running gateway is the pod's main process. So the image sets a
  supervisor `ENTRYPOINT` (`mcp_entrypoint.sh`) that starts the MCP server in a
  restart loop in the background, then execs the base entrypoint so `gateway
  run` still runs as the main process under the s6-overlay supervision tree.
- **Image**: `hermes_prompt.py`, `mcp_server.py`, and `mcp_entrypoint.sh` are
  copied into the image at `/opt/hermes-mcp/` (plus `fastmcp` + `redis` installed
  into `/opt/hermes/.venv`). **Changing either file changes the DEPLOYED IMAGE,
  not just the repo** — rebuild (`docker build -t sudo-agent:latest -f Dockerfile .`)
  or `up.sh` will refuse to deploy a stale image.
- **Limitation**: `--list` / cross-agent name resolution is host-side only
  (needs `kubectl`/kubeconfig) and is intentionally not exposed by the per-pod
  MCP.

## Queue: the prompt distributor

Between the MCP door and the agent's brain sits a Redis-backed queue, so that an
MCP client that fires N prompts at once gets N *queued runs*, never N parallel
runs racing the same agent state.

- **Topology**: one SHARED Redis for the whole Hermes fleet
  (Deployment `sudo-agent-redis`, `hostNetwork: true` on `127.0.0.1:6380`,
  `dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet`, PVC `sudo-agent-redis-data`, AOF on
  `appendfsync everysec`, strategy `Recreate`). It is deliberately **not**
  `sudo-letta-redis`: each factory keeps its own queue backing.
  Because the queue lives in a PVC-backed Redis, it survives agent pod
  recreation **and** Redis pod recreation; only losing the PVC loses it.
- **Per-agent namespace**: one Redis serves every agent, so keys are prefixed
  `sudo-agent:q:<unique-per-agent>` (`:items`, `:inflight`, `:res:<msg-id>`).
  The suffix is `AGENT_NAME` (injected by `up.sh`, unique per deployment),
  falling back to `POD_NAME`, then `MCP_PORT`. Without this, two agents would
  steal each other's prompts.
- **One drain worker per pod**: the MCP server starts exactly one consumer
  thread, which feeds `hermes -z` one prompt at a time.
- **Atomic claim**: the worker takes the next item with a single Redis
  transaction (`WATCH`/`MULTI`: remove from `:items`, push to `:inflight`), so
  exactly-one-at-a-time is enforced **by Redis**, not by Python timing. The
  in-flight item is no longer visible as pending, and a crash cannot re-run a
  prompt twice concurrently. (Message ids are unique, so the removal by value is
  exact.) Any item abandoned in `:inflight` by a hard crash is moved back to the
  front of the pending list on the worker's next connect — at-least-once, never
  a silent drop.
- **Ordering rule** (verbatim):
  a. first message in = processed first
  b. then drain ALL remaining messages from that same source before anyone else
  c. when empty, move to the NEXT MOST RECENT source and drain it fully
  d. FIFO within a source
- **Offline fallback**: if `REDIS_URL` is unset, `mcp_entrypoint.sh` starts a
  per-pod `redis-server` on a port derived per agent
  (`40000 + (MCP_PORT*7) % 20000`, injective over the MCP_PORT range — never
  6379/6380, since even localhost ports are node-global here), bound to
  `127.0.0.1`, AOF on, data in `/opt/data/redis/` on the agent PVC. This is for
  degraded/offline operation only; the deployed default is the shared Redis.

## Verification order (hard rule, learned the hard way)

**Never write "verified" in a commit message before the verification output
exists; if a test runs after the commit, say so in a follow-up commit.**

Corollary: a claim in a commit message is a promise about evidence you already
have in hand. "It should work" is not evidence, and a build/import that is not
re-checked is not a deploy.

## What --privileged Enables

- `mount` / `umount` — FUSE, tmpfs, bind mounts
- `modprobe` — load kernel modules
- Access all `/dev/*` devices
- `dmesg`, `perf`, `ptrace` — system introspection
- Network manipulation (interfaces, iptables)
- Docker socket passed through for container management

## How Auto Memory Works

The agent automatically saves preferences, facts, corrections, and context without any manual commands. At the start of every session, memory entries are injected into the system prompt. There's no "remember this" command — it just does it.
